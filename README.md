unfinished-games
================

a repository of unfinished games that may indeed never be finished
this is a test.

this is for idiots who can't remember stuff like me:

  git add . (to add stuff)

  git commit -m "commit message"

  git push (update online repo)


also needed to do:

  git remote set-url origin https://{username}:{password}@github.com/RobinTPotter/unfinished-games.git

before it would work. presumably only once.


Oh and pyopengl you need to iNstall numpy Somehow

oh.. and .. on one windows machine couldn't work with pyopengl_accelerate, uninstalled and worked fine...
